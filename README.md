# Currency Conversion App
A simple currency conversion app that will convert rates based on live data

# Development
Idk how long this will take but I am planning for this to grow in stages.

Stage 1 - Simple hardcoded conversion rates and currencies
Stage 2 - Add live rates 
Stage 3 - Polish up conversion and rounding, rework structure.
Stage 4 - Add UX using either JavaFX or JFrame.
